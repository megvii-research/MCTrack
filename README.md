This is the official repo release of the paper [MCTrack: Unified 3D Multi-Object Tracking Framework for Autonomous](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16149)

## 0. Abstract

This paper introduces MCTrack, a new 3D multi-object tracking method that achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo datasets. Addressing the gap in existing tracking paradigms, which often perform well on specific datasets but lack generalizability, MCTrack offers a unified solution. Additionally, we have standardized the format of perceptual results across various datasets, termed BaseVersion, facilitating researchers in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT) to concentrate on the core algorithmic development without the undue burden of data preprocessing. Finally, recognizing the limitations of current evaluation metrics, we propose a novel set that assesses motion information output, such as velocity and acceleration, crucial for downstream tasks.
